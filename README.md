# FizzBuzz
This is just a javascript loop, function, and condition practice.

#Skills I put in this game
As I said before this is intended for practice as a pre-beginner.

-function
-loop(while)
-condition(if..else)
-some such built-in functions as toUpperCase(), prompt(), alert(), but I don't wanna use prompt or alert functions. So, I would like to combind with html and css soon after this have worked.
